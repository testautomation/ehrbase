# EHRbase

EHRbase is an [openEHR](openehr.org) Clinical Data Repository, providing a standard-based backend for interoperable clinical applications. It implements the latest version of the openEHR Reference Model (RM 1.0.4) and version 1.4 of the Archetype Definition Language (ADL). Applications can use the capabilities of EHRbase through the latest version of the [openEHR REST API](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-REST/latest/) and model-based queries using the [Archetype Query Language](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/QUERY/latest/AQL.html).

## Release Notes
##### 2020, March 3
This release of EHRbase (2020-03-03) provides several improvements, especially regarding stability and bug fixes. However, we consider EHRbase to be still in alpha status. Please see [EHRbase Documentation](https://ehrbase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01_release_notes/0110.html) for further details.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Please read these instructions carefully. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need Java JDK/JRE 11 (preferably openJDK: e.g. from https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

You will need a Postgres Database (Docker image or local installation). We recommend the Docker image to get started quickly.

When installing locally, the Postgres Database (at least Version 10.4) needs the following extensions:
 * [temporal tables](https://github.com/arkhipov/temporal_tables) 
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/arkhipov/temporal_tables.git
     make
     sudo make install
     make installcheck
     ```
 * [jsquery](https://github.com/postgrespro/jsquery) 
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/postgrespro/jsquery.git
     cd jsquery
     make USE_PGXS=1
     sudo make USE_PGXS=1 install
     make USE_PGXS=1 installcheck
    ```

### Installing

#### 1. Setup database

> NOTE: Building EHRbase requires a properly set up and running DB for the following steps.

Run `./db-setup/createdb.sql` as `postgres` User.

You can also use this Docker image which is a preconfigured Postgres database:
```shell
    docker network create ehrbase-net
    docker run --name ehrdb --network ehrbase-net -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d -p 5432:5432 ehrbaseorg/ehrbase-postgres:latest
```

(For a preconfigured EHRbase application Docker image and its usage see [below](#Docker))
#### 2. Setup Maven environment

Edit the database properties in  `./pom.xml` if necessary

#### 3. Build EHRbase
Run `mvn package`

#### 4. Run EHRbase

Replace the * with the current version, e.g. `application/target/application-0.9.0.jar`

`java -jar application/target/application-*.jar`


## Running the tests

This command will run all tests from `tests/robot` folder.
DB and server application will be started/stopped by the tests accordingly. You *must not* start them by hand.

> NOTE: Make sure you meet the PREREQUISITES mentioned in tests/README.md prior to test execution.
>
> Please Check the README in `tests` folder for more details.

```bash
cd tests
./run_local_tests.sh
```


## Deployment

 1. `java -jar application/target/application-*.jar` You can override the application properties (like database settings) using the normal spring boot mechanism: [Command-Line Arguments in Spring Boot](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-command-line-arguments)
 2. Browse to Swagger UI --> http://localhost:8080/ehrbase/swagger-ui.html


## Docker

### Locally Build Docker Image

First build the application as described in [Installing](#Installing)

To create a Docker image run the following command and provide the correct build output file name created in the previous step, e.g. application-0.10.0.jar for version 0.10.0.

`docker build -f application/Dockerfile --build-arg JAR_FILE=application-*.jar -t ehrbaseorg/ehrbase:latest .`

To run the built container image use the following command:

`docker run --name ehrbase --network ehrbase-net -d -p 8080:8080 -e DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://ehrdb:5432/ehrbase -e DB_USER=ehrbase -e DB_PASS=ehrbase -e SYSTEM_NAME=local.ehrbase.org ehrbaseorg/ehrbase`.

Adopt the parameters by your needs. The following parameters for `-e` must be set to start the EHRbase container:

| Parameter   | Usage                                                    | Example                                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| DB_URL      | Database URL. Must point to the running database server. | jdbc:postgresql://ehrdb:5432/ehrbase  |
| DB_USER     | Database user configured for the ehr schema.             | ehrbase                                   |
| DB_PASS     | Password for the database user                           | ehrbase                                   |
| SYSTEM_NAME | Name for the local system                                | local.ehrbase.org                         |

### Pre-build Docker Image

See: https://hub.docker.com/r/ehrbaseorg/ehrbase

There is also a preconfigured `docker-compose.yml` file, which sets up and starts the necessary database and EHRbase 
application with, for instance:

```shell script
cd application
docker-compose up
```

Notes: It is not necessary to have the whole repository on your machine, just copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to
a local working directory and run it. Using the `-d` argument starts both containers detached, without blocking the 
terminal. And the DB data is saved in `application/.pgdata` for easier access.
